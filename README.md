# Effect of Risk Score Difference on Classification Statistics

This Shiny app explores how changes in risk scores affect classification performance. It visually demonstrates shifts in sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy as a function of decision thresholds and score variation.

## About

Originally developed in response to ProPublica's bias claims about COMPAS, this app was presented at the 2016 ASC Conference to illustrate how small changes in scores can significantly impact classification metrics. While the original source code is no longer available, I am in the process of rebuilding and enhancing it with improved visualizations and interactivity.

## Planned Updates

- Rebuild the full Shiny source code using a modern UI layout
- Add download options for plots and statistics
- Provide a detailed methodology in a companion write-up
