This Shiny app explores how changes in risk scores affect classification performance. The tool visually demonstrates shifts in sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy as a function of decision thresholds and score variation.

## About

This app was originally developed to refute bias claims about COMPAS by ProPublica; it was used at the ASC 2016 Confernce. While the original source code has been misplaced, I am currently in the process of rebuilding and enhancing it with better visualizations and updated interactivity.

## Planned Updates

- Rebuild full Shiny source code using modern UI layout
- Add download options for plots and statistics
- Provide detailed methodology in a companion write-up
